# Scrape Meta

## Instructions

### Step 1: Scrape Meta
- Go to https://www.dotabuff.com/heroes?show=heroes&view=played&mode=all-pick&date=7d&rankTier=immortal&position=core-mid
- for each role (carry, midlaner, offlaner, sup 4, sup 5), create a list of heroes from most played to least and dump them into an yaml file "meta.yaml". You can toggle the role filter to generate lists for different roles
